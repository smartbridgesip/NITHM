This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook for predicting hospital readmission for patients with diabetes using the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). 

The methodology behind this notebook is explained in my Medium Blog post: https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hospital-readmission-for-patients-with-diabetes-using-scikit-learn-a2e359b15f0

This project was created based on the conda environment.yml file provided in the repo.
